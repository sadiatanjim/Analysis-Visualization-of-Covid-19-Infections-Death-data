# Analysis and visualization of Covid-19 Infections & Death data

## Dataset:

The Data for this project has been collected from [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) [1]

## Data Preperation:

* Downloaded the csv file for the dataset from the [source](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)
* The dataset was split into two separate subsets for Analysis and stored into the following two xlsx files:
    * CovidDeaths.xlsx
    * CovidVaccination.xlsx
* The *.xlsx files were imported to Microsoft SQL Server to create two separate Databases

## Data Exploration:

Data Exploration was performed using SQL Queries in Microsoft SQL Server. The SQL Queries for data exploration are included in the file **SQL_DATA_EXploration.sql**

The following Explorations were performed on the Data: 

* Selecting Relevant Data
* Show likelihood of death by country
* Percentage of population that contracted Covid
* Identify countries with high infection rates
* Identify countries with highest death count
* Analyze Data by Continent
* Calculate Global numbers
* Joining of Population + Vaccination Data
* Analyze Death w.r.t Population & Vaccination using CTE/TEMP Table
* Create views for visualization
* Stored procedure (for later)

## Data Visualization in Tableau: 

We have perfomed the Data Visualization using Tableau. A Tableau Dashboard has been created with the data from the previous step. A Snapshot of the Dashboard is as follows:
